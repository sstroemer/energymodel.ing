Follow any of the links below, down into a rabbit hole --- but do not blame me if you find yourself late for an important date.

- [A general space](/general/):  
  _A place for those (posts) that do not belong --- outcasts, wanderers, visionaries, and misfits._
- [The paper digest](/digest/):  
  _Thoughts, comments, ideas, or useless notes on papers that I may have partially read._
