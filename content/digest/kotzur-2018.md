The paper by Kotzur, Markewitz, Robinius, and Stolten is amongst the most cited ones regarding the simplification of <abbr title="Energy System Optimization Models">ESOMs</abbr>, by reducing their temporal resolution. Existing open-source <abbr title="Energy System Optimization Models">ESOMs</abbr>, like [Calliope](https://www.callio.pe/) or [PyPSA](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa), build upon their proposed formulations[^1].
